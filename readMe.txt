# RISC-V Assembler and Simulator

## Overview
This project is a RISC-V assembler and simulator that converts RISC-V assembly code into machine code and simulates its execution. It includes both a backend for assembling and simulating the machine code and a frontend for interacting with the system via a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features
- **Assembler:** Converts RISC-V assembly instructions into machine code.
- **Simulator:** Executes the generated machine code, handling registers and memory.
- **GUI:** Provides an interface for users to input assembly code and visualize execution.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js and npm
- A C++ compiler (GCC/Clang/MSVC)
- Any required dependencies for the backend (if applicable)
- Nlohmann JSON library

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <https://github.com/VikashMehra01/CS204.git>
   cd <https://github.com/VikashMehra01/CS204.git>
   ```

2. Navigate to the backend folder and compile (if required):
   ```sh
   cd backend

3. Start the backend server:
   ```sh
   ./server
   ```

4. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   ```

5. Install dependencies (if not already installed):
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

6. Start the frontend:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
